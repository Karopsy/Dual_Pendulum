Final Project MAE200 Controls - Dual Pendulum

In order to have a better understanding of the function and the overall objective of those code and this project, please read the PDF named "Final Project Dual Pendulum MAE200 Report".
However, this document is not exhaustive and will not give you all the details to grasp the interest of this problem. 
For that, I refer to professor Bewley's book called "Numerical Renaissance". 

Thank you for reading and I hope this work can help you for your own project. Especially a function to solve the Differential Riccati Equation is developped and 
can surely be very interesting for a lot of other projects than only the stabilization of a dual pendulum.
